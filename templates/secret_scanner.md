# Secret Scanning enabled :wave: :lock:

Hey there!

As you may have seen, We've enabled Secret Scanning for you.


The purpose of this issue is:

- Give you some context as to why Secret Scanning is now enabled.
- Provide you with some links to help you understand what Secret Scanning and GitHub Advanced Security are.

As a company, Tyler Technologies is progressively deploying Secret Scanning on all of our repositories. We didn't expect you to have to go and manually turn it on for every single repository, so here's a notice saying that we've done it for you.

We are rolling out Secret Scanning per repository, so if you have only got a informative notice for a few of your repositories, not to worry, more will come.

We want to make sure **you** are empowered to maintain the security of your repositories. Thus we count on you to properly react when a secret scanning alert is triggered, following the documentation below:

- [Removing sensitive data from Github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)
- [Managing alerts from Secret Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/secret-scanning/managing-alerts-from-secret-scanning)


If you need any more assistance, please don't hesitate to contact a member of Github Administrative team:
- Teams: `Corp DevOps / Github Community`
- Jira : [TCPSD Support Queue](https://tylerjira.tylertech.com/servicedesk/customer/portal/21)

We are here to help.

Thanks!

- Github Administrative Team
