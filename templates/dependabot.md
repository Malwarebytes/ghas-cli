# Dependabot Enabled :wave:

Hey there!

As you may have seen, We have enabled Dependabot and Dependency Graph for you on this repository.


The purpose of this issue is:

- Give you some context as to why Dependabot and Dependency Graph are now enabled.
- Provide you with some links to help you understand what Dependabot and Dependency Graph are.

Tyler Technologies has been progressively deploying Dependabot and Dependency Graph on all of our repositories in order to provide you 1) with an easy way to stay informed when your dependencies are vulnerable and 2) A one-click semi-automated update process with contextual information.

We didn't expect you to have to go manually turn these features on for every single repository, so this is simply a notice saying that we've done it for you.

We are gradually rolling out Dependabot and Dependency Graph to our repositories based on some internal prioritization, so if you have only got a informative notice for a few of your repositories, not to worry, more will likely be enabled before too long.

We want to make sure **you** are empowered to maintain the security of your repositories. Thus we count on you to properly react when a vulnerability alert is triggered, following the documentation below:


- [What to do when a dependency vulnerability alert is triggered?](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)
