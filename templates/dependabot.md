# Dependabot Enabled :wave:

Hey there!

As you may have seen, I've enabled Dependabot and Dependency Graph for you.


The purpose of this issue is:

1) Give you some context as to why Dependabot and Dependency Graph are now enabled.
2) Provide you with some links to help you understand what Dependabot and Dependency Graph are.

As a company, we have been progressively deploying Dependabot and Dependency Graph on all of our repositories in order to provide you 1) with an easy way to stay informed when your dependencies are vulnerable and 2) A one-click semi-automated update process with contextual information.

We didn't expect you to have to go and manually turn these features on for every single repository, so this is simply a notice saying that we've done it for you.
We are rolling out Dependabot and Dependency Graph per teams, so if you have only got a informative notice for a few of your repositories, not to worry, more will come soon.

We want to make sure **you** are empowered to maintain the security of your repositories. Thus we count on you to properly react when a vulnerability alert is triggered, following the documentation below:


1) [What to do when a dependency vulnerability alert is triggered?](https://malwarebytes.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IS/pages/2698150159/How+to+make+use+of+Dependabot+alerts)


If you need any more assistance, please don't hesitate to contact a member of Application Security team (tag @Malwarebytes/security-appsec in this issue, or `#github-appsec-security` on Slack). We are here to help.

Thanks!
